# **Drum 🥁 Set**

An interactive and fun virtual Drum Kit built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking buttons on the screen or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard.

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive layout with styled drum pads.
- Interactive UI with keypress and mouse click functionality.
- Smooth audio playback for each drum sound.
- Visual feedback when a key is pressed or a button is clicked.
- Clean, elegant design with custom fonts and background.

## 🎯 How It Works

- Each button is mapped to a specific drum sound.
- When a button is clicked or a matching key (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) is pressed, a corresponding `.mp3` sound is played.
- JavaScript handles the event listeners for both mouse clicks and keyboard presses.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Page structure.
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Event handling and audio playback.
- **Google Fonts** – Typography enhancement using *Arvo*.
